# Entry 1

Alright to start off my first blog entry, I will be talking about which tool I chose and why I chose it. Then I will talk about what I am going to make with the tool. 

Looking through the [FP Tool List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jWx2c2JSDv4Qqbep2zjPMX6-nMr6hgiJCMKNfNCGRAQ/preview), at first I chose [Aframes](https://aframe.io/) because I wanted to make an explorable map with Modern houses/neighborhoods in 2022 if we had no electricity or technology. I did not choose this tool because I felt like I should make something that could help me out and be used in the future. So I decided to make a [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications/1046823089150894101/bot) because I use Discord almost daily. What I want to make with my Discord bot is a data input saver and caller. Basically, the bot will take any information you want to give it and you can retrieve it when you call it. I read through a documentation called [discordpy](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html), and it helped me get my bot set up and put into a server. 

Skills that I used and developed were communication and how to google. I used communication by asking my classmate who has made a discord bot, questions about what I can make with a bot. I used the skill, how to google, by finding documentation that could help me get started with creating the bot and putting it into a server.

On the Engineering design process I am on step 1, defining the problem. The problem is that important data or information can be easily lost in your device. My plans for step 2 of the EDP, research the problem, is that I will research the average amount of data being lost from a user every month.
