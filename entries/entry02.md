# Entry 2
##### 12/12/22

Welcome back to my blog entry! This is blog entry 2; I will be talking about how i‚Äôve been learning my tool. I will also be talking about my FP goal for the winter break.

So far how i‚Äôve been learning my tool was by watching [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yLfjMtsV9s&list=LL&index=64) about people making their discord bot go online and interacting with them. So basically i was learning the starter code. I also looked through this documentation by [pragnakalp](https://www.pragnakalp.com/create-discord-bot-using-python-tutorial-with-examples/), and it helped me get discord installed into my ide. It told me to put this line, `pip install discord` and `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py` into my terminal so I can get discord installed into my ide or else my code will not run. After that I made a new folder in my ide and called it ‚Äúfp‚Äù; after that I created a file called ‚Äúbot.py‚Äù. I had to include the .py because it will run python in the file. So in my bot.py file I then put `import discord`, so it can run discord in the file. 

Alright, for my FP goal during the winter break is to get the bot to come online and respond to my messages. (Since I handed this after winter break, I am happy to announce that I accomplished this goal üëç)

Skills that I used were how to google and attention to detail. I used attention to detail by reading through the documentation carefully because if I didn‚Äôt download discord into my terminal than my code would not have worked in the future. I also used how to google by find videos and documentations on how to start my bot.

On the Engineering Design Procces, I am still on stage 2. I will need to research more about how much data gets lost and what effect it has on people. For the next stage of the EDP, I plan to brainstorm possible ways on how people will store their data into the bot, like will they need to say a code word before telling the bot what to store.
